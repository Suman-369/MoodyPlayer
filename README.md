### 2. Update the Code

Open `main.js` and replace `YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` with your actual Spotify Client ID:

```javascript
const SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'your_actual_client_id_here';
```

### 3. Run the App

   # Using Python (if you have Python installed)
   python -m http.server 3000
   
   # Using Node.js (if you have Node.js installed)
   npx http-server -p 3000
   ```

2. **Option 2: Live Server (VS Code)**

   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

3. **Option 3: Any Local Server**
